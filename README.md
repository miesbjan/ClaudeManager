# Markdown Viewer

A small live Markdown viewer for Windows. Open several `.md` files from anywhere on
disk, each in its own tab, and see them re-render automatically whenever another
program (an editor, a generator, an AI agent) rewrites the file.

It is a viewer only — no editing, no sidebar, no workspace management.

Where this is heading is written down in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build a Windows package

```bash
npm run build        # NSIS installer + portable exe in ./release
npm run build:dir    # unpacked app only (faster, for smoke tests)
```

Other scripts: `npm run compile` (bundle without packaging), `npm start`
(run the bundled app), `npm run typecheck`.

### If packaging fails with "Cannot create symbolic link"

electron-builder unpacks its `winCodeSign` helper archive, which contains macOS
symlinks; creating symlinks on Windows needs elevation or Developer Mode, so the
step fails on a default account. Either turn on *Settings → System → For
developers → Developer Mode*, or pre-extract the archive once, skipping the two
mac symlinks:

```bash
CACHE="$LOCALAPPDATA/electron-builder/Cache/winCodeSign"
node_modules/7zip-bin/win/x64/7za.exe x "$CACHE/<downloaded>.7z" \
  -o"$CACHE/winCodeSign-2.6.0" -y -xr'!'libcrypto.dylib -xr'!'libssl.dylib
```

This is a machine-wide electron-builder issue, not specific to this project.

## Controls

| Input                     | Action                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+O`                  | open Markdown file(s)                     |
| `Ctrl+W`                  | close the current tab                     |
| `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | next / previous tab                   |
| `Ctrl+1` … `Ctrl+9`       | jump to tab by position                   |
| `Ctrl+R`                  | force reload of the current file          |
| `Ctrl+D`                  | switch theme: Auto → Light → Dark         |
| `F12`                     | toggle DevTools                           |
| middle-click a tab        | close it                                  |
| right-click a tab         | reload, close, close others, copy path, reveal in Explorer |
| drag & drop               | drop `.md` files into the window to open them |

Files passed on the command line are opened too, so the app works as a handler for
`.md` files (the installer registers the association).

## Behaviour notes

- **Live reload.** Each open file is watched with `chokidar`
  (`awaitWriteFinish` + `atomic`, so partial writes and write-temp-then-rename
  saves are handled). An mtime/size poll every 1.5 s is a fallback for events the
  OS watcher drops, e.g. on network shares. Scroll position survives a reload.
- **Deleted files** stay open and marked *unavailable*; they reload by themselves
  if the file reappears.
- **Duplicate names.** Tabs show the file name, extended with as many parent
  directories as needed to stay unambiguous.
- **Theme.** The toolbar button (or `Ctrl+D`) cycles Auto → Light → Dark. *Auto*
  follows the Windows setting; the other two force the palette. The choice is
  applied through `nativeTheme.themeSource`, so it also covers native chrome such
  as scrollbars and dialogs, and it is remembered between launches.
- **Session.** The list of open files and the active tab are stored in
  `%APPDATA%/md-viewer/state.json`, together with the window geometry, and restored
  on the next launch. Files that no longer exist are shown as unavailable.
- **Relative links.** Clicking a relative link to another `.md` file opens it in a
  new tab; `http(s)` links open in the default browser.
- **Images** referenced relatively or by absolute path are served through a
  dedicated `mdasset://` protocol, so they work in dev and in the packaged app.

## Security model

Markdown is untrusted display content, so:

- `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`
- `markdown-it` runs with `html: false` — raw HTML in the source is escaped, not
  parsed, so an injected `<script>` is shown as text
- `markdown-it`'s default link validation rejects `javascript:` and similar URLs
- a strict CSP in `index.html` (`default-src 'none'`, `script-src 'self'`) blocks
  inline scripts and remote code
- the renderer reaches the filesystem only through a fixed set of preload methods
  (`src/preload/index.ts`); there is no generic "run this in main" channel
- navigation and `window.open` from document content are denied; external URLs are
  handed to the system browser

## Layout

```text
src/
  main/
    index.ts         Electron main: window, IPC, protocol, security policy
    fileWatcher.ts   chokidar watchers + poll fallback for arbitrary file paths
    store.ts         session/window state in userData/state.json
  preload/
    index.ts         the whole renderer-to-main API surface
  renderer/
    index.html       CSP + minimal shell markup
    src/main.ts      UI wiring: tabs, live reload, shortcuts, drag & drop
    src/tabs.ts      tab bar rendering + duplicate-name labelling
    src/markdownRenderer.ts  markdown-it setup, highlighting, task lists, assets
    src/styles.css   document + chrome styling, light and dark
  shared/
    types.ts         types shared across the three processes
```

`examples/sample.md` exercises every supported Markdown feature — useful for
checking rendering and live reload.
